# 🔨 Fix-It Felix: Workshop Management System

## About the Project

This project involves the development of **Fix-It Felix**, a **Management System for Auto Repair Workshops**, created as a practical assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** discipline at the **Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP)**.

The main objective is to apply core Object-Oriented concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, in building a functional application.

### 🎮 Thematic Inspiration: Fix-It Felix Jr.

The system's name and interface are inspired by the hero **Fix-It Felix Jr.** from the *Wreck-It Ralph* animated movie. The visual aesthetic uses a vibrant color palette and elements reminiscent of arcade games (8-bit), making the management experience more engaging and fun, focusing on the idea of **fixing** and **restoring**.

### System Scope

The system is divided into two main panels, reflecting the different actors and their responsibilities:

1.  **Workshop Panel (Administration):**
    * Complete management of clients, vehicles, and orders (Service Orders).
    * Definition of service types offered (Body Repair, Polishing, Maintenance, etc.).
    * Control of vehicle types the workshop services (Motorcycle, Car, Van).
    * Profile update and security settings.

2.  **Client Panel:**
    * Viewing and editing personal profile and registered vehicles.
    * Real-time tracking of order/service status.
    * Quick scheduling of new services.
